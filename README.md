You need to create a two-page nextJS application using typescript.

 

• Use redux for state management.

 

• You have the creative freedom to design the effects, look and feel if you want, but the styling should be done using CSS modules (using SCSS).

Use Vanilla CSS only, not use Bootstrap, Tailwind or other ui libraries/frameworks.

 

• Use Contentful CMS to store and fetch data for the app.

===

• The first page is Google SSO.

• People should be able to use the email address to logon.

•The second page is a dashboard. It should be a protected route.

===

•The dashboard should comprise of the following elements:

A signout  button.

 

 

A card which displays the Name, email and pic of the person who logged in using the Google SSO.

 

An accordion with 3 tabs.

In the first tab of the accordion you wanna add a 3d chart using the E-Charts library.

 

The content for the chart and other tabs should be fetched from the Contentful cms during build time, resulting in a static website.

 

You have the creative freedom to use mock data. 

===

 

Deliverables:

Deploy the app on Vercel and share its link.

The Github link of the codebase.

Max Test Duration: 1 day

Evaluation criteria includes the following:

• The quality of your code, i.e. how well you document and add comments for the utility functions, components, file structure, etc.

• Whether the team encounters any bugs when they run your code on their systems and the overall UX of the deployed app.
